### **CryptoClustering**

#### Overview
The **CryptoClustering** project aims to apply machine learning techniques to **cryptocurrency data** in order to classify cryptocurrencies based on their features.

#### Key Objectives
- Preprocess and normalize cryptocurrency data for analysis.
- Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., K-Means clustering) to group cryptocurrencies into clusters.
- Visualize the clustering results using dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA and t-SNE.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
